      <p >
        In this fast technologically advancing world, it has become important
        for the humans to interact with computers to provide assistance in many
        fields like medicine, education, space research, etc. Retrieval of the
        required information from the database is a tedious process. In order to
        extract information from the database, the user must have a prior
        knowledge on Database Management System (DBMS), which is a software
        developed to store and manipulate the data in a database. Hence a
        non-technical user faces difficulty in extracting the data. To find a
        solution for such a problem and facilitate human interaction with
        computers, Natural Language Processing(NLP) techniques are used.The two
        main challenges that have to be solved simultaneously are: Question
        complexity (depth) & Domain size (breadth). Our project is a humble
        attempt to solve the Domain size challenge, by extracting data with
        natural queries from .csv files
